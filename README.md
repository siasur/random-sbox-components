# What is this?
Well, probably a graveyard. I am currently having some fun with the developer preview of S&Box, the spiritual successor to Garry's Mod made by Facepunch. I create new projects test some ideas, learn to use the editor, and more.
Doing that I might create components that I don't really have a use for right now, but don't want to lose them. Mainly to be used as a reference and learning resource but maybe even to be used and improved at a later stage.
